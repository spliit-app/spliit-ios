"""Print the UDID of the simulator with this exact name.

    xcrun simctl list devices -j | find-simulator.py "Spliit Shots main iphone-6.9"

The UDID rather than the name, because the name is not a stable address: a clone left behind by
a parallel test run is called "Clone 1 of <name>", and a device is reachable by its own name
right up until something creates a second one. It is also the only way to reach the device's
preferences on disk, which is where a screenshot run sets the system language.
