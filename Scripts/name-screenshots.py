"""Give exported xcresult attachments the names the test gave them, and check their size.

`xcresulttool export attachments` writes every attachment under a generated file name and
records the real one in a manifest. The real one is the whole point — "01-groups" is what puts
the screenshot first in App Store Connect — so this is the step that turns one into the other.

    name_screenshots.py <exported dir> <destination dir> <expected WxH>

Anything that is not the size App Store Connect accepts for the device is a hard error: a
listing is rejected for it, and the rejection arrives days later.
